<h1>3.0 JDT Launching Change Notes</h1>
<p>This document describes important changes in the 3.0 JDT launching support, relative 
  to the 2.1 release.</p>
<h2>API Changes</h2>
<h3>VMRunnerConfiguration contains environment</h3>
<p>Two methods have been added to the <code>VMRunnerConfiguration</code> type
  to support the setting and retrieving of environment variables.
<p>Implementors of <code>IVMRunner</code> should call
  VMRunnerConfiguration#getEnvironment() and pass that environment into
  the executed VM. Clients who use DebugPlugin#exec(String[] cmdLine, File workingDirectory)
  can do this by calling DebugPlugin#exec(String[] cmdLine, File workingDirectory, String[] envp)
  instead. Simply passing in the result from getEnvironment() is sufficient.</p>
